The four R-files contain the code to reproduce all analyses and figures in the paper of the four model classes:

examples_mgm.R (MGMs)
examples_tvmgm.R (time-varying MGMs)
examples_mvar.R (mixed VAR models)
examples_tvmvar.R (time-varying mixed VAR models)

All used data are included in the mgm package and are loaded automatically.
